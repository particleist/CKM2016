\section{Introduction}
Neutral beauty mesons can oscillate into their antiparticles through the exchange of $W^\pm W^\mp$ pairs, so that the 
physical states (those with well defined masses and lifetimes) are admixtures of the flavour eigenstates. This gives
rise to both mass ($\Delta m_{(d,s)}$) and width ($\Delta\Gamma_{(d,s)}$) splittings in the $B^0_d$ and $B^0_s$ systems, as well
as two types of related $CP$ violation. The first, $CP$ violation in mixing, occurs when the meson and antimeson have different
probablities to oscillate into each other, and is predicted to be very close to zero in the Standard Model (SM) with a very
small theoretical uncertainty. The second, $CP$ violation in the intereference of decay and mixing, occurs when both the meson
and antimeson can decay to the same final state, and the decay paths with and without intermediate mixing interfere. This kind of $CP$
violation is highly sensitive to the imaginary phase of the CKM matrix and its absolute size depends on the final state in question.

Aside from their intrinsically fundamental nature, measurements of mass and width splittings and mixing-related $CP$ violation are
of great interest because many of the observables can be predicted very precisely in the SM, and because new particles or force-carriers
beyond the SM (BSM) can alter these predictions in experimentally observable ways. Many different experimental collaborations have contributed
to our understanding of mixing in the $B$ system, from the inital discovery of $B$ mixing by the ARGUS collaboration~\cite{Prentice:1987ap}, to precise measurements
of $\Delta m_{(d,s)}$ and the CKM-angles $\alpha$ and $\beta$ at the b-factories and Tevatron, to recent precise measurements
of $\phi_s$, $\Delta\Gamma_s$, and first precise mixing-related measurements of the CKM-angle $\gamma$ at ATLAS, CMS, and LHCb. At the same
time, great progress has been made in making more precise theoretical predictions of the SM values of many of these quantities, making
these experimental measurements sensitive probes of BSM physics.

The remainder of this document covers the current status of experimental measurements for each observable of
interest, as well as their near-term outlook. Section~\ref{sec:phisdgs} covers measurements of $\phi_s$ and $\Delta\Gamma_s$, section~\ref{sec:dmdgd} 
mesurements of $\Delta m_{(s,d)}$. Section~\ref{sec:photpol} covers the measurements of photon polarization in radiative decays, while
sections~\ref{sec:alpha}~to~\ref{sec:gamma} cover measurements of the CKM angles $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$, respectively.
For historical reasons, measurements of $CP$ violation in neutral meson mixing are covered in the proceedings of WG2~\cite{WG2PROC}. We then discuss
ongoing theoretical developments relevant to our WG in Sec.~\ref{sec:theory}. Finally we conclude,
and discuss the medium to long-term outlook for mixing-related measurements in the $B$ system.
