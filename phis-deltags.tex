\section{Measurements of $\phi_s$ and $\Delta\Gamma_s$}
\label{sec:phisdgs}

The $\phi_s$ weak phase and $B^0_s$ meson decay width difference can
be extracted by a time dependent full angular decay analysis of the 
$B^0_s \to J/\psi K^+ K^-$ decays. Such measurements have traditionally
used the subset of decays where the $K^+ K^-$ pair originates in the decay
of a $\phi$ meson, because its narrow width allows for an excellent background
rejection, but since the conference the first measurement which uses
the full $K^+ K^-$ mass spectrum~\cite{LHCbKKHighMass} has become available, and
more such measurements are expected in the future. The importance of
$\phi_s$ is that, in the absence of significant loop-diagram contributions
to $B^0_s \to J/\psi K^+ K^-$ decays (``penguin pollution''),
its value is precisely predicted~\cite{PHISSM} in the SM
\begin{equation}  
\phi_s = -0.036 \pm 0.002 \; ,
\end{equation}
and accurate experimental measurements of $\phi_s$ are therefore 
sensitive probes of the presence of BSM effects in the mixing and decay of $B^0_s$ mesons.

The results that the ATLAS~\cite{ATLASPHIS} and CMS Experiments obtained on their Run1
datasets using $B^0_s \to J/\psi \phi$ decays are:
\begin{eqnarray}
  \phi_s & = & -0.090 \pm 0.078 (\mbox{stat}) \pm 0.041 (\mbox{syst})\:[\mbox{rad}] \; , \\
  \Delta\Gamma_s & = & \phantom{-}0.085 \pm 0.011 (\mbox{stat}) \pm 0.007 (\mbox{syst})\:[\mbox{ps}^{-1}]  \; ,
\end{eqnarray}
for ATLAS \cite{atlas_phis_8TeV} and:
\begin{eqnarray}
  \phi_s & = & -0.075 \pm 0.097 (\mbox{stat}) \pm 0.031 (\mbox{syst})\:[\mbox{rad}]  \; , \\
  \Delta\Gamma_s & = & \phantom{-}0.095 \pm 0.013 (\mbox{stat}) \pm 0.007 (\mbox{syst})\:[\mbox{ps}^{-1}]  \; ,
\end{eqnarray}
for CMS \cite{cms_phis}. As can be seen in Fig.~\ref{phis_atlas_cms} both measurements are in
excellent agreement with the SM expectations.

The LHCb measurements of $\phi_s$ are covered in detail elsewhere in these proceedings~\cite{LHCBPHISPROC}.
LHCb uses not only $B^0_s \to J/\psi \phi$ but also $\Bs\to \jpsi\pi^+\pi^-$ decays,
where the $\pi^+\pi^-$ system is dominated by the $f_0(980)$ resonance and is greater than $97.7\%$ \CP-odd.
In this case no angular analysis is required, considerably simplifying the measurement
and providing important complementarity of systematic uncertainties.
The analysis of $B^0_s \to J/\psi \phi$ finds $\Delta\Gamma_s = 0.0805  \pm 0.0091         \pm  0.0032$~ps$^{-1}$,
where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic. 
A combination of $B^0_s \to J/\psi \phi$ and $\Bs\to \jpsi\pi^+\pi^-$ gives $\phis = -0.010  \pm  0.039$~rad, which is the most 
precise single-experiment determination of this quantity.
LHCb has also measured $\phi_s$ using $\Bs\to \psi(2S)\phi$ decays, obtaining
$0.23^{+0.29}_{-0.28} \pm 0.02$ rad.

While $B^0_s \to J/\psi K^+ K^-$ is expected to be dominated by the tree-level diagram,
as the experimental precision on $\phi_s$ improves it will become increasingly important
to account for residual penguin pollution~\cite{PENGUINPOLTHEORY} in order to correctly interpret any agreement,
or otherwise, with the theoretical prediction. The size of such effects can be controlled
using a combination of $B^0_s \to J/\psi K^{*0}$ and $B^0 \to J/\psi \rho$ decays,
which are related by U-spin symmetry and in the limit of zero non-factorizable SU(3)
breaking are sensitive to the same, universal, penguin amplitudes and phases.
LHCb has performed measurements of both modes~\cite{LHCb-PAPER-2015-034,LHCb-PAPER-2014-058} and
measures essentially zero penguin pollution to $\phi_s$ with a precision of around 15~mrad
in all three polarization-dependent phases. The LHCb measurement is statistics limited
and penguin pollution to $\phi_s$ should therefore
remain under control as the experimental precision approaches the SM value.

In addition to comparisons with the SM prediction, such tree-dominated measurements of $\phi_s$ can also be compared with the measurement
of the related quantity $\phi_s^{ss\overline{s}}$ in the loop-dominated decays $\Bs \to \phi\phi$ and $\Bs\to \Kp\pi^-\Kp\pi^-$.
In the absence of BSM physics effects, this quantity is expected to be very close to zero.
LHCb has measured~\cite{LHCb-PAPER-2014-026} $\phi_s^{ss\overline{s}} = -0.17 \pm 0.15 \pm 0.03$ rad using
$\Bs\to \phi\phi$, in excellent agreement with the SM prediction. The measurement,
which uses $\Bs\to \Kp\pi^-\Kp\pi^-$, is ongoing; it is considerably more challenging and
requires a two-dimensional Dalitz analysis to account
for the interfering intermediate resonances. 

LHCb has also measured~\cite{LHCb:2017ood} the time-dependent $CP$ violation in $B^0 \to \pi^+ \pi^-$ and $B^0_s \to K^+ K^-$ decays.
These can be interpreted\footnote{In the absence of information about $B^0_s \to K^+ K^-$, measurements of time-dependent $CP$ violation in
$B^0 \to \pi^+ \pi^-$ have traditionally~\cite{HFAG} been combined with other two-body $B^0$ decays in an isospin analysis to obtain a measurement of $\alpha$.}
in a combined U-spin analysis~\cite{Fleischer:1999pa} as either measurements of $\gamma$ or $\phi_s$.
Because the combined U-spin analysis is much less sensitive
to U-spin breaking~\cite{LHCb-PAPER-2014-045} when interpreted as a measurement of $\phi_s$, this is therefore the currently preferred way
to interpret the measurements of these $CP$ observables.

$CP$ violation in $B^0 \to \pi^+ \pi^-$ has been measured previously by BaBar~\cite{Lees:2012mma} and Belle~\cite{Adachi:2013mae},
while the measurement of $B^0_s \to K^+ K^-$ is unique to LHCb. Using a two-dimensional fit to the mass and decay-time
of the neutral $B$ mesons, LHCb observes $CP$ violation in the interference of mixing and decay of $B^0_s$ mesons for the first time, 
and finds
\begin{eqnarray}
C_{\pi\pi}      &=& -0.24 \pm 0.07 \pm 0.01,\phantom{space}
S_{\pi\pi}      = -0.68 \pm 0.06 \pm 0.01,\phantom{space}
\\
C_{KK}      &=& \phantom{+}0.24 \pm 0.06 \pm 0.02,\phantom{space}
S_{KK}      = \phantom{+}0.22 \pm 0.06 \pm 0.02,\phantom{space}
\\
A^{\Delta}_{KK}      &=& -0.75 \pm 0.07 \pm 0.11,\phantom{space}
\end{eqnarray}
where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic. It can be seen that the (co)sinusoidal $C$ and $S$ parameters have
negligible systematic uncertainties, while the hyperbolic $A^{\Delta}_{KK}$, which is sensitive to differences in the distributions
of $B^0_s$ and $\bar{B^0_s}$ induced by $\Delta\Gamma_s$ at high decay-times, is much more sensitive to experimental effects.
This is the most precise single-experiment
determination of $S_{\pi\pi}$, and significantly improves the world-average of this parameter as shown in Fig.~\ref{b2pipiwahfag}.
A combined interpretation in terms of $\phi_s$ is not available at the time of writing but is expected to be performed
in the future, and both LHCb and Belle-II are expected to improve our knowledge of the $CP$ observables in the future. 
The measurement of $A^{\Delta}_{KK}$ is a world first, allowing for a twofold reduction in the ambiguity of the $\phi_s$ determination
and can also be interpreted as a measurement of $\Delta\Gamma_s$.
