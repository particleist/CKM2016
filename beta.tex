\section{Measurements of the CKM angle $\beta$}
\label{sec:beta}

The BaBar and Belle Collaboration obtained the first observation of $CP$-violation
in the channels $B^0 \to D^{(*)}_{CP} h^0$, where $h^0$ is a light unflavored neutral
meson, by combining their final datasets \cite{babar_belle_D0h0}. Neglecting the
very small contribution from the $CKM$ suppressed amplitude $b \to u\bar{c}d$,
the time dependent analysis is sensitive to $\sin(2\beta)$. A joint likelihood,
sharing the same physics parameters but independent background modeling parameters,
the two experiments find:
\begin{eqnarray}
-\eta_f S & = & +0.66 \pm 0.10 (\mbox{stat}) \pm 0.16 (\mbox{syst}), \\
C & = & +0.02 \pm 0.07 (\mbox{stat}) \pm 0.03 (\mbox{syst}), 
\end{eqnarray}
with the significance of the observation beeing 5.4 standard deviations.
